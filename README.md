# LengthOfCharArrays

* This project aims to do calculating length of arrays and words inside them using C. The project is liscensed under MIT Liscense and can be used in basically anywhere with giving credits. (I don't care that much if you give credit or no. But I'd appreciate it if you do.)

Goodluck!
